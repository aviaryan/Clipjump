<h4><a name=bu>Basic Usage</a></h4><br>
<ul>
<li>After Downloading Clipjump, unzip it and run Clipjump.exe .<br>
It's a portable application so no installation is needed.<br>
<li>When you run the exe, Clipjump's icon will be seen in SystemTray.<br><br>
<a href="../images/trayicon.jpg"><img src="../images/trayicon.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br>
<li>Try copying either by Ctrl+C or by Right Click -> Copy or Shift+PrintScreen
<li>You will notice a Tip, <b>[Transferred to Clipjump]</b>  when you copy something.This will mean that the copy has been succeeded.<br><br>
<a href="../images/copy.jpg"><img src="../images/copy.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br>
<li>Now, press <b>Ctrl+V</b>(paste action), you will see a tip containing the file or text to be copied.<strong class="super">[This is Paste Mode]</strong>.
If an Image has been copied, a Window showing your image will pop-up.<br>
You will have to release Ctrl to perform actions. <i>(You will know later)</i><br>
Here, Release Ctrl to paste.<br> <br>
<a href="../images/pasting.jpg"><img src="../images/pasting.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br>
<li>To move through Multiple Clipboards, press V again while holding Ctrl. [while in Paste Mode]<br>
Release Ctrl to Paste.Tap C while holding Ctrl to move backwards.
<li>To Cancel Copy, press X while in Paste mode <b>[Ctrl Pressed]</b>.<br>
The tip should change to a Cancel Message. This is <strong class="mild">[Cancel Mode]</strong><br>
Release Ctrl to confirm.<br>
<a href="../images/cancel.jpg"><img src="../images/cancel.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br>
<li>To Delete Current Clipboard, press X twice in Paste Mode or once in Cancel Mode.
The tip should now change to a Delete Message. This is <b>[Delete Mode]</b><br>
Release Ctrl to confirm.<br><br>
<a href="../images/delete.jpg"><img src="../images/delete.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br>
To Delete all Clips, press X thrice in Paste Mode OR twice in Cancel Mode OR once in Delete Mode.
The tip should change to a Delete All message.This is <b>[Delete All Mode]</b> <br>
<a href="../images/deleteall.jpg"><img src="../images/deleteall.jpg" border="0"></a><br>
Release Ctrl to confirm.
</ul><br>
<h3>Notes</H3><ul>
<li>As you can see, Releasing Ctrl is the basis of performing actions in Clipjump.
<li>Also, note that Cancel Mode,Delete Mode and Delete All Mode are inter-related.
<strong class="mild">The program cycles through these modes when you press X while holding Ctrl.</strong><br>
<b>So, pressing X while holding Ctrl in Delete All Mode will switch back to Cancel Mode.</b>
</ul><br>
<hr><br>

<h2><a name=au>Advanced Usage</a></h2>
<a name="fixate">
<h3><a name=fx>The Fixate Option</a></h3>
The Fixate option is meant to hold a current Clipboard at a fixed position while
positions of all other Clipboards change.<br>Thus, if a Clipboard is fixed at [Clip 1], it
will stay there at Clip 1 even after numerous Copies and Cuts.<br>
This can be useful if you want a Clipboard entry to be easily accessible every time you
go in Paste Mode using Ctrl+V. <br>
<strong class="super">Please note</strong> that Clipjump remembers last pasted clip's position. So, if you have just pasted [Clip 5], Clipjump will
<b>start from [Clip 5]</b> the next time you press Ctrl and then V [Paste Mode].<br>
A workaround to go to [Clip 1] quickly can be going into [Cancel Mode] after pressing Ctrl+V and canceling and then again pressing Ctrl+V.
Clipjump will now start from [Clip 1]<br><br>
<strong class="super">Using Fixate</strong><br>
Pressing SPACE while in [Paste Mode] toggles the Fixed status of a Clip.<br>
If you reach the clip of your choice and want to fix it, press SPACE and you
will notice a "[FIXED]" written after <b>(Clip x of y)</b>.<br>
This means the Clip is Fixed there. As said above , <strong class="mild">pressing SPACE again
on the fixed clip will remove the FIX from it and the "[FIXED]" from the tip will disappear.</strong>
<br><br>
<a href="../images/fixate.jpg"><img src="../images/fixate.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br>
<strong class="super">Note that the DeleteAll option will delete FIXED Clips too.</strong><br><hr><br>

<h3><a name=path>Copying Paths to Clipjump</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Pressing the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+C will copy path(s) of selected files in all file managers including Windows Explorer.<br>
<a href="../images/path.jpg"><img src="../images/path.jpg" border="0"></a>
<li>Pressing the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+X will copy path of current opened folder in all file managers including Windows Explorer.
</ul>
</a><hr><br><br>

<h3><a name=fdata>Copying File content to Clipjump</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Pressing the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F will copy selected file's content to Clipjump.
<li>This function works with all file managers including Windows Explorer.
<li>This module will also work on Image files and <a href=#export>exported Clipboard files (.cj)</a>.
</ul>
<br><br>

<h3><a name=paste>Changing Paste-Mode shortcut</a></h3>
To force Clipjump Paste Mode to be activated by some other key other than Ctrl+V, you can use the Settings editor of Clipjump. <br>
Simply open the editor and look for the <code>Paste Mode(Ctrl +..)</code> value in the <code>Shortcuts</code> group. Change the default <i>V</i> in the box to some other key to make the Clipjump Paste Mode to be activated by the Ctrl combination of that key. Make the value blank  to disable <code>Clipjump Paste Mode</code>.
<br><br><br>

<h3><a name=ot>One Time Stop</a></h3>
Many a times you have applications that use Clipboard's common transfer to extract data from various locations.
These apps can be a headache when used with as consistent a tool as Clipjump. <br>
The <b>One Time Stop</b> feature just solves this problem. Available with the configurable shortcut Alt+S, you can call it once to make Clipjump automatically ignore the 
last data and linked content that is transferred to System Clipboard and so Clipjump.  In this period, what really happens is that the Clipjump Clipboard Monitoring is 
deactivated , a feature which can be controlled via <a href="../clipjumpcontroller.html">Clipjump Controller</a>. <br> 
<strong class=super>NOTE</strong> - When Clipboard Monitoring is disabled (as in One Time Stop) , Clipjump's tray icon will become dark.  
<br><br>
<strong class=super>WARNING</strong> - <b>One Time Stop</b> is deactivated when Paste Mode is accessed in the <i>ignore</i> period.
<br><br><br>

<a name="winclip">
<h3>Selective Windows Clipboard</h3></a><br>
Many a times there are situations where <b>you are not allowed to paste using the old shortcut Ctrl+V</b> (like in Command Prompt).<br>
There the Selective Windows Clipboard Option comes handy.<br><br>
<strong class="super">Using</strong><br>
Cycle through the clipboards by Ctrl+V or C .When you reach the clip of your choice,
<b>press S</b> while holding Ctrl.<br>
You will see a Confirmation <b>(System Clipboard has Clip x)</b> in form of tip.
That's it.<br>
Now, the Right-Click > Paste Or any other option to Paste <i>other than the old Ctrl + V</i>
will paste the Clip you had choose like it is  currently stored in System Clipboard.<br><hr><br>


<a name=nof><h3>No-Formatting Mode</h3>
No formatting mode truncates formatting from Clipjump clips when they are pasted.<br>
To access this mode, use the "Z" key as the toggle when in <strong class=super>[PASTE MODE]</strong><br>
Press "Z" once while in [PASTE MODE] and you will see a <strong class="super">[NO-FORMATTING]</strong> in the Tip.<br>
This will mean all the clipboard data pasted from now onwards will have Formatting truncated.<br>
To disable this mode, press "Z" again while in [PASTE MODE] and the [NO-FORMATTING] text will dissappear.<br><br>
<strong class=super>Note that</strong> that the No-Formatting setting doesn't mean that clips copied will not have any formatting, this means that the formatting will be 
removed from them <b>temporarily</b> when they are pasted.<br><br>
<img src="../images/noformat.jpg" border="0">
<br><br>
<strong class=super>TIP</strong> - To make Clipjump start by default in NO-FORMATTING mode , change the <code>Start_with_formatting</code> value in the <code>[ADVANCED]</code> section of Settings.ini to 0.
<br><br><br>

<a name=export><h3>Export and share Clipboards</a></h3>
Clipjump supports exporting clipboards as files which can be stored as a record OR send to a friend.<br>
The feature is accessible by tapping <code>E</code> in <strong class=super>[PASTE MODE]</strong> and by the shortcut <code>Ctrl+E</code> in the Clipjump History Tool.<br>
The Clip or Clipboard when exported will be saved in "My Documents" with a name <code>export[x].cj</code> where <code>x</code> is a variable.<br>
The <code>.cj</code> file extension when used with <a href=#fdata>Copy File Data</a> directs Clipjump to load the file contents into itself.
<br><br /><br>

<a name=misc><h3>Miscellaneous</a></h3>
<strong class=super>Showing the Pasting tooltip</strong> - You can make Clipjump show a <code>Pasting..</code> tip when you paste some data. To do so, change the value of <code>Show_pasting_tip</code> in the [Advanced] section of Settings.ini to 1.
<br><br>

<strong class=super><a name="syscopy">Setting shortcut to copy to system Clipboard (bypassing Clipjump)</a></strong> - You can also create a unique shortcut in Clipjump to copy/cut data only to System Clipboard 
and not Clipjump. To create these shortcuts, open the [Advanced] section of Settings.ini and write down shortcut values for <code>windows_copy_shortcut</code> and 
<code>windows_cut_shortcut</code>. As you may have guessed, these shortcuts are disabled by default and by writing shortcut values for them in the ini you create them.
<br>These shortcuts can be very useful when in need to copy sensitive or crap information of the Clipboard.
