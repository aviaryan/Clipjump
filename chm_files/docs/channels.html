<h2><a name=about>About</a></h2>
Clipjump Channels are meant to allow users to use multiple channels of multiple Clipboards for sorting related Clipboard items together.<br />
You can use the <a href="organizer.html">Channel Organizer</a> to organize your channels and clips within the channels. (accessible from the <a href="basic_help.html#actmd">Action Mode</a> with easy key <kbd>O</kbd>). 
Selecting the channel to be pasted from can be done using the <a name=chnlsel>Channel Selector</a>. This feature is accessible from the <a href=basic_help.html#actmd>Action Mode</a> with easy key <kbd>S</kbd> as well as the Tray Menu. <br />
Another method of selecting the channel is described in <a href=#chnljumps>Changing Channels in Paste Mode</a>.<br>
<br />
Channels are different series or groups in which clips are stored. <br /> 
You can create unlimited <strong>distinctly named</strong> channels to store Clipboard data and store related clips in them. <br />
The default channel is 0 and is named as <i>Default</i>.<br />
<br />

<h2><a name=using>How to Use</a></h2>
As said above, use the action mode shortcut or the Tray menu for Clipjump to open the Channel Selector Window.<br />
The Window should appear instantly and you will see the Channel Number 0 (Default) to be active by default.<br />
Use the <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> arrow keys and select a different channel. As 0 is the only channel used in a new installation of Clipjump, you will be only allowed to select the next Channel 1 . 
Select the new channel and <b>give it a name</b>. Now click <span class="str">Use Channel</span>. You will see a tip containing a confirmation message 
<span class="str">Channel <var>name</var> is now active</span> where <var>name</var> is the name of your channel.<br />

Now try copying some data to Clipboard and you will see that the confirmation tip <span class="str">Transferred to Clipjump</span> is now preceeded by the string 
<var>{name}</var> which will mean the item is now captured to Clipjump channel 1. <br />
	
Now press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> and release <kbda>V</kbda> to enter <a href="basic_help.html#pastemd">[Paste Mode]</a> . You will see a <var>{name}</var> also preceeding the Clip number message <span class="str">Clip x of y</span> . As you have already guessed , this means that the clip is contained in the Channel <var>name</var> .<br>
<a href="../images/channelpaste.jpg"><img src="../images/channelpaste.jpg" border="0"></a>
<br /><br>
Now as you are using Channel 1, you can open the Channel window and use the next available Channel (Channel 2) . <strong class=mild> You can use as many as channels you want </strong> and give them any name you like.<br />
<br />
	
<h4><a name="channel_notes">IMPORTANT</a></h4>
Note that Clipjump uses Channel 0 as the default and the main channel and should be used for general purposes. Channel 0 (Default) is the only channel for which the 
<span class="str">Minimum Number of Active Clips</span> setting is valid, all other channel have no minimum and thus store unlimited clips. <br>
The setting <span class="str">Retain Clipboard data upon Application restart</span> is invalid on channels other than 0 and so channels 1+ store clips until they are deleted by the user.
<br/><br>

<h2><a name=chnljumps>Changing Channels in Paste Mode</a></h2>
<span class="ver">[v9.5+]</span> You can change channels in the <a href="basic_help.html#pastemd">Paste Mode</a> itself by using the Up-down keys . Use the <kbd>Up</kbd> arrow key to increment the channel by 1 and use the <kbd>Down</kbd> arrow key to decrement the channel by 1. Cycling channels via this method works like a cycle , so if you press the Up arrow key with the last Channel (say #2) active , you will be jumped back to the first channel (#0).

<br><br>

<h2><a name=uses>Ideas on using</a></h2>
One of the best uses of Clipjump Channels is using it as a top 10 repository for storing frequently used items. As said above , you can copy and thus save your signatures , blog links and avatar images in a channel and quickle access them when needed.<br>
See Also: <a href=#protected>Protected Channels</a>

<br><br/>
	
<h2><a name=protected>Protected Channels</a></h2>
Protected Channels are user defined special channels that require confirmation before each copy of clipboard data to them. <br>
If you copy some text while a protected channel is active, you will see a confirmation tip with a sharp beep to proceed further. This can be very useful and should 	be used a check to store data in a <i>precious</i> channel that is damn meant to store single kind of data.<br>
To create a protected channel, precede it's name with _ i.e. a underscore . Any channel whose name starts with an underscore is a protected channel.<br>
<strong class="mild">Tip</strong> - To remove the beep, change the variable <var>protected_DoBeep</var> to 0 from <a href="custom.html">ClipjumpCustom.ini</a>.<br>
The code is <code class=syntax>protected_DoBeep = 0</code>. Add it in a section with no 'bind', one which is auto-executed at Clipjump start.
<br><br>

<h2><a name=pit>The "Pit" Channel</a></h2>
The Pit channel is a reserved channel NAME with automatic Incognito feature. When a channel is named as <code class="key">Pit</code>, the channel does not transfer it's clips to the Clipjump History thus creating a false <code class="key">Incognito mode</code> situation. Note that when a channel named <code class="key">Pit</code> is active, the <code class="key">Incognito mode</code> is physically not turned ON and so you don't see the Clipjump's tray icon being grayed out.<br>
The Pit channel can be quickly used to capture <i>junk</i> or <i>confidential</i> data to Clipjump and then delete them all at once with the <strong>Delete ALL mode</strong> (Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>, release <kbda>V</kbda>, press <kbd>X</kbd> 5 times)
<br><br>

<h3><a name=pitswap>PitSwap</a></h3>
<span class="ver">[v9.5+]</span> PitSwap allows you to jump to an existing Pit channel from any other active channel with the ease of a hotkey. Activated with the <a href=basic_help.html#actmd>Action Mode</a> easy key <kbd>P</kbd> , it is a sort of 'channel toggler'. When pressing PitSwap shortcut when a channel such as Default(#0) is active , the channel will be automatically changed to a found <a href=#pit><code class="key">Pit</code></a> named channel. When pressing the shortcut , the toggle will work in reverse changing the active channel back to the one you were using (here 'Default') . Note that the PitSwap toggle is deactivated <b>silently</b> when you first use PitSwap and then eventually change the Pit channel with the <a href=#chnlsel>Channel Selector</a> GUI OR by the <kbd>Up</kbd>/<kbd>Down</kbd>keys in the <a href=basic_help.html#pastemd>Paste Mode</a>.

<br><br>

<h2><a name=min>Minimal Gui</a></h2>
Minimal GUI for <a href=#chnlsel>Channel Selector</a> can be activated from the <a href=settings.html>Settings Editor.</a> <br>
When activated , you will see a no-button window in place of the original <a href=#chnlsel>Channel Selector</a> GUI. You will have to use <kbd>Up</kbd>/<kbd>Down</kbd> arrow keys to change channels and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to activate a channel. <br>
Use <kbd>Del</kbd> key to delete a channel and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close (cancel) the GUI.

<br><br>
	
<h2><a name=tips>Tips for better productivity</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>For channel 1 to 9, you can also use <a href=basic_help.html#actmd>Action Mode</a> to change channels. See <a href=basic_help.html#actmd_num>How</a>.
<li>You can use the <kbd>up</kbd>/<kbd>down</kbd> arrow keys rather than Mouse clicks for increasing/decreasing Channel numbers.
<li>When in the default <a href=#chnlsel>channel selector</a> mode, use <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> as a shortcut for the <span class="str">Use Channel</span> button.
<li>Use <a href=#min>Minimal GUI</a>
<li>If you regulary change Clipjump channels, you can also create a system-level shortcut for opening channels manager directly rather than using 
	a 2nd level <a href=basic_help.html#actmd>Action Mode</a> shortcut from the <a href=settings.html>Settings Editor</a>.</ul>
