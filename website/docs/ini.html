<h2>General</h2>
The file settings.ini is used to store the settings of ClipJump. It's located in the same directory where the Clipjump executable resides.
<br>
Clipjump provides <a href="settings.html">several methods</a> to manipulate the settings file
<h2>Advanced Settings</h2>

<h3><a name="syscopy">Setting shortcut to copy to system Clipboard (bypassing Clipjump)</a></h3> - You can also create a unique shortcut in Clipjump to copy/cut data only to System Clipboard 
and not Clipjump. To create these shortcuts, open the [Advanced] section of Settings.ini and write down shortcut values for <var>windows_copy_shortcut</var> and 
<var>windows_cut_shortcut</var>. As you may have guessed, these shortcuts are disabled by default and by writing shortcut values for them in the ini you create them.
<br>These shortcuts can be very useful when in need to copy sensitive or crap information of the Clipboard.
<br><br>

<h3><a name=actmd_keys>Changing Action Mode Easy keys</a></h3>
Action Mode keys can be changed through ClipjumpCustom.ini, please see <a href="custom.html#actmd">this</a> example.<br>
To disable a key, empty its value. In the following example, F1 AND L keys are removed.<br>
<pre>[actionmode_delete_bad_keys]
ACTIONMODE.F1=
ACTIONMODE.L=</pre>
<br>

<h3>Showing the Pasting tooltip</h3> - You can make Clipjump show a <code>Pasting..</code> tip when you paste some data. To do so, change the value of 
<var>Show_pasting_tip</var> in the <em>[Advanced]</em> section of Settings.ini to 1.

<br><br>

<h3><a name="prior">Changing default Task Priority</a></h3> - You can change default Clipjump Task priority from the Priority key in the System section of the Ini.
<br>Set Priority to H (high) to make Clipjump most responsive.<br> Priority Values can be-<br>
<pre>L (or Low), B (or BelowNormal), N (or Normal), A (or AboveNormal), H (or High), R (or Realtime)</pre>

<br>

<h3><a name="ram_flush"></a>Make Clipjump flush RAM contents to disk <span class="ver">[v12+]</span></h3> - The <var>RAM_flush</var> option when enabled instructs Clipjump to flush its RAM 
memory data to hard disk at needed intervals. Thus Clipjump will take much less RAM (<= 1.5 MB) but the overall performance may be affected. I recommend keeping this option disabled 
(set to 0) which is what it is by default. You can find <var>RAM_flush</var> in [System] section of Settings.ini
<br><br>

<h3><a name="pst_custom_pos">Show paste mode at fixed position</a></h3>
You can fix the Paste Mode's screen position by adding values to variables <var>pstMode_X</var> and <var>pstMode_Y</var> in the Advanced section of the Ini.<br>
The X coord is pixels from left of the screen whereas the Y coord is pixels from top of the screen.<br>
You can also leave either of the coords blank and only the specified axes (X or Y) will be fixed for the paste mode.
