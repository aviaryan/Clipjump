<h2><a name=intro>Introduction</a></h2>
Plugins are AutoHotkey scripts that are run by the Clipjump.exe which is nothing but AutoHotkey.exe in disguise.<br>
Some plugins are included in the program at runtime, some are not (external class). There is no limit on the number of plugins and they can be always accessed from 
the Plugin Manager (ActionMode = M)
<br><br><br>

<h2><a name=filename>The Filename</a></h2>
The filename of the plugin symbolizes the function it is supposed to contain. <br> If filename is <em>myplugin.ahk</em> , it means the plugin file contains a 
<code>plugin_myplugin()</code> that is run by the Plugin Manager or <code>API.runPlugin()</code>. If the filename is <em>pformat.noformatting.ahk</em> , the 
 main function the file has is <code>plugin_pformat_noformatting()</code>.
<br><br><br>

<h2><a name=params>Plugin Parameters</a></h2>
If you open any of the officially distributed plugins in Notepad, you will see lines starting with <code>;@Plugin-</code>. These hold the key-value pairs that 
have information about the Plugins.<br>
So <code class="Syntax">;@Plugin-Name myplugin</code> gives the key <var>name</var> for the plugin the value <var>myplugin</var>. As you may have guessed this is the 
same thing you see when you click on Properties in the Plugin Manager.<br>
There is no limit on what can be the 'key' here. Even <code>;@Plugin-authorSite http://mysite.com</code> also works and is shown in the Properties window.
<br><br><br>

<h2><a name=funcparams>Script/Function parameters</a></h2>
The Plugin parameters like <code class="syntax">;@Plugin-param(N)</code> where <var>N</var> is a natural number are the Function parameters (like <code>;@Plugin-Param1</code>). 
They hold information about the <var>Nth</var> parameter of the main function in the plugin file. 
When you run a plugin with <code class=syntax>API.runPlugin( plugin_filename , param1, param2 ....)</code> without any 'param's , the function auto-asks you the parameters 
 showing these informations if they are present. 
You can provide a parameter as <code class=syntax>;@Plugin-Silent 1</code> to force <code>API.runPlugin()</code> to <b>not ask</b> the user for parameters even if no parameter is passed to it.<br>
Function parameters are not Mandatory but it is recommended to provide them.
<br><br><br>

<h2><a name=conventions>Conventions</a></h2>
<ol>
	<li>Variable Names in plugin files that are included (not external) should start with <em>z</em>. This is because Clipjump doesn't uses any variable starting with 
		'z' and so this is the best option to avoid variable conflicts.
	<li>The parameter names in the function definition ( <code class=syntax>plugin_myplugin(zParam1, zParam2)</code> ) should also start with 'z'.
</ol>
<b>TIP-</b> You can use the STORE object to also store variables. It is a <b>global</b> object and is totally meant for storing by plugins and through
 <a href="../custom.html">ClipjumpCustom.ini</a>. Eg> <code class=Syntax>STORE.myvar := "text"</code> and <code class=Syntax>zVar := STORE.myvar</code>
<br><br><br>

<h2><a name=classes>Plugin Classes</a></h2>
'Classes' is a way to distinguish certain plugins from normal plugins. All the plugins whose name is like <em>a.b.ahk</em> and not <em>b.ahk</em> mean they belong 
to a class (here <var>a</var>).<br>
As already said, these files have main function like <code class=syntax>plugin_a_b()</code>.
Currently Clipjump has 2 defined classes. User is not allowed to create them. (i.e. create a file like xyzPlugin.coreScript.ahk)
<br><br>

<h3><a name=class_pformat>pformat</a></h3>
The plugins in this class are used in the paste-format option in Paste mode (key = Z). Officially distributed plugins like <em>pformat.sentencecase.ahk</em> and 
<em>pformat.noformatting.ahk</em> belong to this class.<br>
<ol>
	<li>These plugins also have a custom mandatory parameter <code>;@Plugin-Previewable</code> which should hold 1 if the paste format is previewable in Paste Mode. 
		It is 1 for SentenceCase.</li>
	<li>These Plugins should make <code>STORE.ClipboardChanged</code> true if they have successfully changed the input variable and thus what is going to be pasted.
		<br>For example <code class="Syntax">STORE.ClipboardChanged := true</code>
	<li>It should be noted that these plugins (should) have 1 input parameter. See the file 'pformat.sentencecase.ahk' for example.</li>
	<li>When toggling and when pasting, Clipjump inputs the <em>Clipboard</em> variable and not the <em>ClipboardAll</em> variable as the first parameter. 
		If the plugin needs the <em>ClipboardAll</em> variable, it can consult it anytime as it will be the same as what current active</li>
</ol>
<br>

<h3><a name=class_ext>external</a></h3>
Plugins whose name starts with <em>external.</em> belong to the 'external' class. They are not included in Clipjump at runtime and solely run through the 
AutoHotkey.exe (i.e. Clipjump.exe) when needed.<br>
<b>The Parameters in external plugins ? </b> Like <a href=#funcparams>Function parameters</a> , the external script file can contain <code>-Param1</code>, 
<code>-Param2</code> and so.. for the <code>API.runPlugin()</code> to take them as Script parameters and thus ask the user if they pass no paramter.<br>
For example try running the <em>external.controller.ahk</em> and then seeing its source code.
<br><br><br>

<h2><a name=things>Things to Note</a></h2>
<ol>
	<li>Use <code>;@Plugin-Silent 1</code> to make <code>API.runPlugin()</code> not ask the user for parameters even if user doesn't enters them.
	<li>It will be a good idea to use <code>API.showTip()</code> and 
		<code>API.removeTip()</code> (<a href=../devList.html#showtip>Link</a>)
	<li>While testing keep in mind that your plugin will be included in Clipjump.ahk and thus run from the directory of Clipjump.ahk. So be careful with the WorkingDir 
		factor.
	<li>There will be no auto-execution of any plugin as a non-external plugin will be included at the bottom of Clipjump.ahk
	<li>Please reload Clipjump when you change/add a plugin file to load it into Clipjump.
	<li>Make sure to have a look at <a href=../devList.html>The Complete Developer List</a> and the <a href=../devList.html#pubapi>public API</a>
</ol>
<br><br>

<h2><a name=libs>Libs</a></h2>
If your plugin file requires more files as #Includes, consider keeping them in (file_name).lib directory. So for the plugin <em>external.controller.ahk</em> 
we have <em>external.controller.lib</em> as the lib directory. This makes the Delete Plugin option in Plugin Manager work.
