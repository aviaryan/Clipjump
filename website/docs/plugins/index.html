Plugins are AutoHotkey scripts that are placed in the plugins folder in Clipjump.exe directory.<br>
They can be accessed from the <a href="#manager">Plugin Manager</a> that runs with the <kbd>M</kbd> key in <a href="../basic_help.html#actmd">Action Mode</a>. 
<br><br>

<a name="manager"></a>
<h2>Plugin Manager</h2>
Plugin Manager is a small tool that lets you deal with currently installed plugins. You can access it with key <kbd>M</kbd> from Action Mode or from Tools submenu in Clipjump's Tray menu.<br>
The UI is kept minimal and you have to right Click on a plugin row to show the various options available.<br>
The Edit Option opens the plugin's source code. After making changes to a plugin or after adding a new plugin, restart Clipjump to make that plugin effective.
<br><br>

<a name="install"></a><h2>Installing a plugin</h2>
Simply copy the .ahk file with all other dependent files in the plugins directory and <b>restart Clipjump</b>.<br>
<b>Note</b> - Clipjump lists all plugins to use at ExitTime and <b>not at runTime</b>. Thus Restarting Clipjump after making changes to plugins is necessary.
<br>
<b>TIP</b> - To disable a plugin temporarily, create a folder named (for example) <em>_Disabled</em> in the plugins folder and move the plugin to it.
<br><br>

<h2><a name="run">Running a plugin from ClipjumpCustom</a></h2>
The <code class="Syntax">API.runPlugin( plugin_file_name , param1 , param2 , param3 , ..... )</code> can be used to run a plugin.<br>
If <b>no</b> parameter (param) is passed at all , then the user will be automatically asked for the needed number of parameters. Below are suitable examples -
{% highlight ini %}
[some_section]
noautorun=1
run = API.runPlugin( some_plugin.ahk )

[some_section2]
bind=Win+Alt+K
run = API.runPlugin( some_plugin.ahk , the_text , the_title )
{% endhighlight %}
<br><br>

<h2>Creating your own plugins</h2>
If you know the AutoHotkey language, you won't take a minute starting creating your first plugins. If you are not familiar with AutoHotkey, I recommended 
<a href="http://ahkscript.org">trying it</a> as it is the ever so easy and suprisingly powerful programming langauge. You <b>won't</b> regret.<br>
See <a href="basics.html">Plugins Basics</a>
